## Recipe
This was an extract kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/blonde-ale-bundle-recipe-kit.html).  The recipe is available online [here](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/media/downloads/23/Blonde%20Ale%20Instructions.pdf).

## Brew Notes
I steeped the grains on the longer end this time, close to the full 30 minutes. Used a brew bag for hops again.

## Tasting Notes
Been craving some blonde ales again and this was one of my favorite brews so it was due for a re-brew. Near the end of my PhD I was too distracted and the airlock dried out on this one in secondary. I tried drinking a little of it, but I wasn't happy with the flavor so I dumped it. This was the first batch I ever dumped.
