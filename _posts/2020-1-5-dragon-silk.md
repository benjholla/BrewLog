## Ingredients
Maillard Malts Specialty Grain (1 lb Flaked Barley, 0.5 lb Briess Black Malt, 0.5 lb Briess Chocolate Malt, 0.25 lb Briess Caramel 120L), 6 lbs Gold malt syrup, 6 lbs Dark malt syrup (10 min late addition), 2 lbs Golden Light DME (10 min late addition), 1 oz Nugget (60 min), 1 oz Glacier (15 min), Wyeast 1056 American Ale yeast

## Recipe
This was an extract kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](https://www.midwestsupplies.com/products/dragon-s-silk-imperial-stout-extract-kit).  The recipe is available online [here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2785/6868/t/3/assets/DragonsSilk-1526680194582.pdf?6488571249124439760).

## Brew Notes
Followed the recipe pretty much to the letter. Steeped grains for 20 minutes. I made a 1200 ml yeast starter on a 24 hour stir plate using the Wyeast 1056 American Ale yeast and a can of [Fast Pitch Canned Wort](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/fast-pitch-canned-wort-4-pack). As I was chilling with my wort chiller I noticed I had forgotten to add the DME (I was trying to do too many things at once), so I heated a gallon of water and added the DME. I continued cooling the original wort and once it was the DME was boiling I added it to the existing wort and finished chilling it. I undershot my OG a little and came out just a tad high.
