## Ingredients
1.109 lbs. golden raisins, .822 lbs. dandelion petals, 2 lbs. light rock candy sugar, 1 teaspoon pectic enzyme, 1 tablespoon acid blend, 1 Campden tablet

## Recipe
This was a recipe we adapted from the book [Making Wild Wines & Meads: 125 Unusual Recipes Using Herbs, Fruits, Flowers & More](http://amzn.to/2dPpyOt). 

## Brew Notes
We deviated a bit by putting the pectic enzyme in with the Campden tablet instead of putting it in later at the start of fermentation with the thought that adding it earlier would give it more time to get a better yield out of the dandelion petals.

A note on pectic enzyme by [Wine Maker Magazine](https://winemakermag.com/858-cellar-dwellers):
> If you want to add pectic enzyme for better juice yield and fruit character, add it during the crush or during pressing. To prevent pectin haze before it occurs, particularly for fruit wines, add pectic enzyme at the beginning of fermentation according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. By adding the enzyme from the start, the enzyme will have more time to break down the pectin as the juice ferments, leaving less pectin to linger afterward and cause haziness. Ideally this first addition will save you time trying to clear the wine after fermentation is finished.
