## Ingredients
6 lbs. Amber liquid malt extract, 3.15 lbs. Gold liquid malt extract, 8 oz. Brown Malt, 8 oz. Crystal 50-60L, 8 oz. Wheat, 4 oz. Chocolate specialty grains, 1 oz. Northern Brewer, 2 oz. Willamette, 2 oz. Fuggle hops, 2 oz. American Oak Cubes soaked in bourbon or whiskey, Safale S-04 yeast

## Recipe
This was an extract kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/bourbon-barrel-old-ale-kit.html).  The recipe is available online [here](https://www.midwestsupplies.com/downloads/dl/file/id/26/product/7710/bourbon_barrel_old_ale_instructions.pdf).

## Brew Notes
Followed the recipe pretty much to the letter. Steeped grains for the full 30 minutes. I made a 1200 ml yeast starter using the Safale S-04 yeast. I finally decided on using a [Cedar Ridge 5 Year Reserve Bourbon Whiskey](http://www.crwine.com/whiskey/) (batch number 7, bottle number 480) to use to soak the oak cubes. Transferred to secondary and added the soaked oak cubes after 2 months.

## Tasting Notes
TBD
