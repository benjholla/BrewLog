## Ingredients
Specialty grains, 6.3 lbs. Gold liquid malt extract and 1 lb. Gold dry malt extract, .5 oz. Calypso hops, 1.5 oz. Equinox hops, Lallemand Belle Saison Ale Brewing Dry Yeast

## Recipe
This was an extract kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/sabotage-saison.html).  The recipe is available online [here](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/media/downloads/768/MWS_Sabotage_Saison.pdf).

## Brew Notes
Followed the recipe and steeped grains for about 24 minutes.  Accidently messed up the hop additions by adding .5 oz. Equinox hops in place of the Calypso bittering hops.  To correct I added the Calypso hops in at the same time as the Equinox hops, then skipped the Equinox hop addition just before the last two Equinox hop additions at the end.

## Tasting Notes
TBD
