## Ingredients
3.3 lbs. Hopped LME, 3.3 lbs. of Dark LME, 1 lb. of Light DME, 1 lb. of Dark DME, 4 oz. Crisp Crystal Extra Dark 120L, 4 oz. Weyermann Roasted Barley, 8. oz Crisp Pale Chocolate Malt, 1 oz. Nugget Hop Pellets, 3 oz. Heavy-Toasted Oak Powder, 2 packets of Fermentis Safale US-05 Yeast

## Recipe
This was a TrueBrew extract kit.  The recipe is available online [here](http://bsghandcraft.com/downloads/TrueBrewInstructions/K58-OakedImperialStout.pdf). I steeped the grains for an extra 5 minutes (for a total of 20 minutes) and added the hops at the 45 minute mark of the 60 minute boil. I am planning to boil the oak powder in 2 cups of water and add the slurry to the secondary once cooled. Alternatively I am considering soaking the oak powder in a bourbon or replacing the powder with some oaked spirals or cubes instead.

## Brew Notes
Some mositure had gotten into DME during a move and turned the DME into bricks. I soaked the DME in hot water for roughly two hours to dissolve it. I pitched the original and a second fresh packet of the dry yeast directly into the wort after chilling. Fermentation began about 24 hours later.

## Tasting Notes
TBD
