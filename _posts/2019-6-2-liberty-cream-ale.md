## Ingredients

## Recipe
This was an extract kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](https://www.midwestsupplies.com).  The recipe is available online [here](https://www.midwestsupplies.com/downloads/dl/file/id/153/product/7884/liberty_cream_ale_all_grain_kit.pdf).

## Brew Notes
I steeped the grains for the full 30 minutes. We chose to decrease the IBUs by only adding .5oz of the bittering hops and only boiling the bittering hops for 30 minutes total. We did boil for the full 60 minutes and added the aroma hops at the last two minutes as was originally reccommended.

## Tasting Notes
TBD
