## Ingredients
6 lbs. Gold liquid malt extract, 6 lbs. Amber liquid malt extract, 8 oz. Carapils, 8 oz. Caramel 40L specialty grain, 1.5 oz. Chinook, 1 oz. Centennial, 2 oz. Cascade hops, Safale US-05 yeast, Red Star Pasteur Champagne yeast

## Recipe
This was an extract kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/bigfoot-s-barleywine-kit.html).  The recipe is available online [here](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/media/downloads/22/Bigfoot's%20Barleywine%20Instructions.pdf).

## Brew Notes
Followed the recipe pretty much to the letter. Steeped grains for about 25 minutes. I made a 1200 ml yeast starter using the Safale US-05 dry yeast. Later I will add the Pasteur Champagne yeast as a finishing yeast. Added the finishing champagne yeast after 2 months.

## Tasting Notes
TBD
