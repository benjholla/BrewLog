## Recipe
This was an extract kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](https://www.midwestsupplies.com/products/dragon-s-silk-imperial-stout-extract-kit). The recipe is available online [here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2785/6868/t/3/assets/DragonsSilk-1526680194582.pdf?6488571249124439760).

## Brew Notes
Followed the recipe pretty much to the letter. Steeped grains for 20 minutes. I made a 1200 ml yeast starter on a 24 hour stir plate using the [Wyeast 1056 American Ale yeast](https://wyeastlab.com/yeast-strain/american-ale) and an [Imperial Yeast Ale Flagship](https://www.imperialyeast.com/organic-yeast-strains/yeast-types/ale/flagship) liquid yeast and a can of [Fast Pitch Canned Wort](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/fast-pitch-canned-wort-4-pack). I undershot my OG a bit and came out high, but I decided to leave it as is since the last batch was near this mark and came out great. 

Soaked the American oak cubes in 12 oz. of [Bib and Tucker small batch bourbon](https://distiller.com/spirits/bib-tucker-small-batch-bourbon), which has a strong charred vanilla flavor, for about two weeks prior to adding. Transferred to secondary (2/14/2021) after 5 weeks in primary, adding the oak cubes and bourbon into secondary using the [Big Mouth Bubbler Depth Charge](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/big-mouth-bubbler-depth-charge). The 12 oz. of bourbon should bring the overall ABV to `((volume of beer * alcohol of beer) + (volume of bourbon * alcohol of bourbon)) / total volume` = `(((640 fl oz * 0.105)+(12 fl oz * 0.46))/(640 fl oz + 12 fl oz)) * 100` = 11.15% ABV. Removed oak cubes from depth charge without reracking at 8 weeks (4/11/2021).
