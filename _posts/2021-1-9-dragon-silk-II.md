## Recipe
This was an extract kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](https://www.midwestsupplies.com/products/dragon-s-silk-imperial-stout-extract-kit). The recipe is available online [here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2785/6868/t/3/assets/DragonsSilk-1526680194582.pdf?6488571249124439760).

## Brew Notes
Followed the recipe pretty much to the letter. Steeped grains for 20 minutes. I made a 1200 ml yeast starter on a 24 hour stir plate using the [Wyeast 1056 American Ale yeast](https://wyeastlab.com/yeast-strain/american-ale) and an [Imperial Yeast Ale Flagship](https://www.imperialyeast.com/organic-yeast-strains/yeast-types/ale/flagship) liquid yeast and a can of [Fast Pitch Canned Wort](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/fast-pitch-canned-wort-4-pack). I undershot my OG a bit and came out high, but I decided to leave it as is since the last batch was near this mark and came out great.
