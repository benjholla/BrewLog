## Ingredients
3 lb. Pilsen Light DME, 3.3 lb. Extra Light LME, 2 lb. Golden Belgian Candi syrup, 1 lb. Soft White Candi sugar, 2 Packs 1 oz. Kent Golding hops, 1 oz. Centennial hops, WLP570 Belgian Golden Ale White Labs yeast

## Recipe
This was an extract kit from [Brewer's Best](http://www.brewersbestkits.com).  The recipe is available online [here](http://www.brewersbestkits.com/assets/1020_belgiangoldenale_recipe.pdf).

## Brew Notes
Followed the recipe pretty much to the letter. I made a 1200 ml yeast starter on a 24 hour stir plate using the White Labs WLP570 Belgian Golden Ale yeast and a can of [Fast Pitch Canned Wort](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/fast-pitch-canned-wort-4-pack). As I was chilling with my wort chiller I noticed I had forgotten to add the DME (I was trying to do too many things at once), so I heated a gallon of water and added the DME. I continued cooling the original wort and once it was the DME was boiling I added it to the existing wort and finished chilling it. I undershot my OG a little and came out just a tad high.
