## Ingredients
3 lbs. honey, 1 head diced garlic, 2 cups fresh chopped Shiitake mushrooms, 1 tablespoon dried thyme, 30 golden raisins, wild yeast or [Red Star Premier Cuvee](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/red-star-premier-cuvee.html) yeast

## Recipe
This was a recipe inspired by a recipe in the book [Make Mead Like a Viking: Traditional Techniques for Brewing Natural, Wild-Fermented, Honey-Based Wines and Beers](http://www.amazon.com/Make-Mead-Like-Viking-Wild-Fermented/dp/1603585982). 

This recipe doesn't have much in the way on instructions. First I diced and roasted the garlic in no stick pan (so I didn't have to use any oil). Then I brought 3 gallons of spring water to a boil. Added the chopped mushrooms at the start of the boil. After 5 minutes took the mushroom stew off the burner and added the honey. Once dissolved, the must was brought back to a boil and then the diced garlic and thyme was added. After 5 minutes of boiling the pot was set aside to cool. After a few hours I removed the thyme. The next morning I stirred vigorously, added the raisins, and transferred to a primary fermenter with an air lock.

## Brew Notes
We used a locally sold pure honey from [Moenck Honey Farms](https://facilityexplorer.iowadnr.gov/facilityexplorer/SiteDetail.aspx?facID=310386848) in Lehigh, IA. The Shiitake mushrooms were [Monterey](http://www.montereymushrooms.com/our-mushrooms/specialty-mushrooms/) brand and the thyme was home grown and dried. The original recipe does not call for thyme, but I had some on hand and threw it in. I took it out after the boil because I was afraid I had put too much in. After it cooled the garlic was the dominant note anyway. The recipe originally called for 4-12 HEADS (not cloves) of garlic! I wasn't that brave and just did 1 large head. 

After a small scare of infection on our [Viking Spring Mead recipe](/BrewLog/viking-spring-mead/) and since there were still no signs of a healthy fermentation I decided not to take any chances with this recipe either and reboiled the must, cooled with a wort chiller, and then added some Red Star Premier Cuvee yeast. Perhaps I just got lucky with my [first wild yeast recipe](/BrewLog/wild-yeast-mead/), but in the future I plan the first harvest wild yeasts and then create starters from wild yeast strains that show promise (as described in [http://bootlegbiology.com/diy/capturing-yeast](http://bootlegbiology.com/diy/capturing-yeast/)).

## Tasting Notes
Wow. Just wow. You really need to be a Viking to enjoy or even drink this. I think some chicken could cook up really nicely with a bit of this though, so I'll have to report back after trying it in a dish.
