## Ingredients
3 lbs. honey, 1 head diced garlic, 2 cups fresh chopped Shiitake mushrooms, 1 tablespoon dried thyme, 30 golden raisins, wild yeast

## Recipe
This was a recipe inspired by a recipe in the book [Make Mead Like a Viking: Traditional Techniques for Brewing Natural, Wild-Fermented, Honey-Based Wines and Beers](http://www.amazon.com/Make-Mead-Like-Viking-Wild-Fermented/dp/1603585982). 

This recipe doesn't have much in the way on instructions. First I diced and roasted the garlic in no stick pan (so I didn't have to use any oil). Then I brought 3 gallons of spring water to a boil. Added the chopped mushrooms at the start of the boil. After 5 minutes took the mushroom stew off the burner and added the honey. Once dissolved, the must was brought back to a boil and then the diced garlic and thyme was added. After 5 minutes of boiling the pot was set aside to cool. After a few hours I removed the thyme. The next morning I stirred vigorously, added the raisins, and transferred to a primary fermenter with an air lock.

## Brew Notes
We used a locally sold pure honey from [Moenck Honey Farms](https://facilityexplorer.iowadnr.gov/facilityexplorer/SiteDetail.aspx?facID=310386848) in Lehigh, IA. The Shiitake mushrooms were [Monterey](http://www.montereymushrooms.com/our-mushrooms/specialty-mushrooms/) brand and the thyme was home grown and dried. The original recipe does not call for thyme, but I had some on hand and threw it in. I took it out after the boil because I was afraid I had put too much in. After it cooled the garlic was the dominant note anyway. The recipe originally called for 4-12 HEADS (not cloves) of garlic! I wasn't that brave and just did 1 large head.
