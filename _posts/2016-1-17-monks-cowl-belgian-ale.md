## Ingredients
2 lbs. Belgian Pale Ale Malt, 0.125 lbs. Belgian Biscuit Malt, 0.25 oz. US Fuggle (bittering addition), 0.25 oz US Fuggle (aroma addition), Safbrew T-58 Ale Yeast

## Recipe
This was an all grain brew-in-a-bag kit from [Midwest Homebrewing Supply](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/monk-s-cowl-belgian-ale-micro-bru-all-grain-recipe-kit.html).  The recipe is available online [here](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/media/downloads/531/MicroBru_Monks_Cowl_Belgian_Ale_Recipe.pdf).

## Brew Notes
I didn't read the directions very well and put in all of the hops as bittering hops and didn't save any for aroma.  Oops. Two brews in a row now...I'm getting sloppy.

## Tasting Notes
TBD
